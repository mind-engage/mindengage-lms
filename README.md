## Dual-Mode Operation

| Mode    | Description | Authentication | Storage | Sync |
|---------|-------------|----------------|---------|------|
| Offline | Runs entirely in a LAN; no internet required. | Local JWT (teacher/student) | Local FS + SQLite/Postgres | Disabled |
| Online  | Full internet-enabled deployment. | OIDC / LTI / JWT | Cloud Storage + Postgres | Enabled |

Switching mode is **runtime configurable** via environment variables (`MODE=offline` or `MODE=online`).

## Architecture

A full architecture diagram and sequence flows are documented in:  
ðŸ“„ [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)

## Development Status

Current implemented modules:
- **API Gateway**: Chi-based HTTP router with JWT middleware.
- **RBAC**: Role-based route protection.
- **Exam Service**: Create, view, and submit attempts.
- **Grading Engine**: OCR + numeric + text match.
- **Storage Service**: Local FS uploads.
- **Offline Auth**: Local JWT-based login.
- **Online Hooks**: Stubs for LTI 1.3 and JWKS.

Planned:
- Sync service for online mode.
- OIDC-based authentication.
- Fully integrated LTI AGS/NRPS.
