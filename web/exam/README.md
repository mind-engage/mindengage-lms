# MindEngage ‚Äî Student Web (web/exam)

Student-facing React app for taking exams and assignments against the MindEngage gateway API.

‚ö° Vite + React + MUI

üîê JWT dev login (stub)

üìù Autosave responses

‚è± Time limit & time left indicator

üìÑ Scan upload to attempts

üîé Uses /exams API to list available exams

This app lives in a monorepo. The Go backend (gateway) runs from cmd/gateway.


## Prerequisites

Node 18+ (or 20+)

npm (bundled with Node)

Go 1.21+ (to run the gateway)

Quick start (dev)
1) Run the gateway API (from repo root)

go run ./cmd/gateway

Defaults:

MODE=offline

SQLite DB

CORS allows http://localhost:3000 (adjust if you use port 5173)

2) Run the web app (from web/exam)

## install deps
npm install

## dev (Vite default port 5173)
npm run dev

## OR bind to port 3000 to match the gateway‚Äôs default CORS:
npm run dev -- --port 3000

If your API base isn‚Äôt the default, create web/exam/.env.local:

VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8080

Build & preview

## Build to dist/
npm run build

## Serve the production build locally
npm run preview

Deploy the contents of dist/ behind any static file server or CDN.
Login (dev)

Gateway issues a dev JWT when username === password and role ‚àà {student, teacher}.

    Student: student / student

    Teacher: teacher / teacher

(Admin appears in the UI but dev auth accepts only student/teacher.)
Typical flow

    Teacher uploads an exam
```
TOK=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"teacher","password":"teacher","role":"teacher"}' | jq -r .access_token)
```

```
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/exams \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data @exam-101.json
```
    Student signs in in this app.

    Student selects an exam from GET /exams (or enters ID):

        Supports search: GET /exams?q=algebra

        Returns: [{ id, title, time_limit_sec, created_at, profile }]

    Load exam ‚Üí Start attempt ‚Üí Answer ‚Üí Submit

        Autosave runs as you type

        ‚ÄúTime left‚Äù chip appears next to the time limit and in the app bar

        On expiry, the app auto-submits

    (Optional) Upload scan of work:
```
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/assets/$ATTEMPT" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $STOK" \
  -F "file=@math-scan.png"
```

Timer notes

    UI shows Time Limit (minutes) and Time Left.

    Countdown starts when an attempt is created, using exam.time_limit_sec.

    If you define only module limits in policy.sections[].modules[], ensure the backend derives/sums an overall time_limit_sec so the UI has a value to show. (Server-side enforcement remains authoritative.)

Environment variables (frontend)

    VITE_API_BASE ‚Äî Gateway base URL (default http://localhost:8080)

Create .env.local in web/exam/ for local overrides.
PWA / meta

    index.html and public/manifest.webmanifest are tuned for PWA installs.

    Place icons under public/icons/ (include maskable variants).

    Ensure the theme color matches your MUI primary (default #3f51b5).

Troubleshooting

    CORS errors in dev
    Either run npm run dev -- --port 3000 or add http://localhost:5173 to the backend CORS allowlist.

    Time limit shows 0
    Your exam JSON lacks top-level time_limit_sec. Provide it or enable backend logic to sum module limits from policy.

    DB schema errors (e.g., ‚Äúno column named profile‚Äù)
    Start with a fresh DB or run the migration that adds profile, policy_json to exams and timing columns to attempts.
